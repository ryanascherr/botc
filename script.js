It is legitimate to show the same player to the Balloonist more than once, if they either have different character types when shown or register as having a different character type. Unless you have a strong reason to, it's usually recommended to not show Travellers early, as this is essentially giving the Balloonist no information at all that night as all players know which players are Travellers without needing to use any abilities.</p><p>If there are no characters of a given type in play and you have shown the Balloonist all other types, stop waking the Balloonist. Note that even if a character of this missing type comes into play on a night after you've stopped waking the Balloonist, do not wake the Balloonist again on a later night to show them this player - the Balloonist ability was complete when you stopped waking them.</p>`,

They do not learn anything else other than their new alignment, they do not know who the Minions or Demon are and they continue to register as a Townsfolk to abilities, it's just their alignment that has changed.</p><p>When the Bounty Hunter wakes, point to an evil player. This can be a Minion, Demon, Traveller or the evil Townsfolk, anyone that is evil or registering as evil. If that player dies, regardless of whether they die at night or during the day, regardless of whether they're evil or not, wake the Bounty Hunter that night and show them a new evil player.</p><p>Note that the Bounty Hunter is quite late in the night order on the first night. This is the time to wake them to show them the player they are learning is evil. The player that started evil, however, should be told immediately on the first night that they are evil and you as Storyteller should also bear this in mind when doing other first night information - that player is already evil even though the Bounty Hunter has not woken yet.</p><p>If the Bounty Hunter is drunk or poisoned or in a Vortox game at any point when they would learn information, you may (must if Vortox) give them incorrect information and show a good player. If they later sober up, they do not learn any new information, even though they still think that a good player is evil. When the player they saw dies, they learn a new player that night.</p><p>If the "known" evil player turns good later, this doesn't affect the Bounty Hunter, that player still needs to die in order for the Bounty Hunter to get further information.</p><p>It's worth noting that, if you feel the Bounty Hunter has already gained a lot of information, it's possible to give a dead evil player or one they've already received. In the former case, if they're dead they cannot die again, so the Bounty Hunter will not get new information unless that player is resurrected and killed again.</p><p>For Travellers, both travelling away and being exiled result in their death - so if a Bounty Hunter has seen a Traveller, either situation would result in the Bounty Hunter getting more information that night.</p><p class="callout-box">Due to the Bounty Hunter adding an extra evil player, extreme caution should be taken when adding it to a script with any other potential alignment changers - as soon as more than one player can be turned evil it's very easy to get an evil voting majority and not even the evil players particularly enjoy that. The script with Goon, Mezepheles, Fang Gu, Politician and Cult Leader has been made before and it isn't fun...</p>`,
